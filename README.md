Library management system

Heroku deployed website url :

To run on local machine setup virtual environment and then inside the git folder do :

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Facebook Test User login credentials:

LoginID: lrittrmrpl_1618655789@tfbnw.net

Password: qwerty@1234

# Admin Login credentials:

Username : admin

Password : admin

# Dummy User Login Credentials:

There are 5 users with 

Username: useri where i in useri is from 1 to 5.

Password for all users is same qwerty@1234.

# SignUp:
Do try this for Google, Github and the normal Signup. Also do provide a real email as verification links will be sent. For facebook it will not work for any account as facebook only allows test users to login.

Also I would suggest to try to login using social on the deployed site only as i had changed the secret keys.
